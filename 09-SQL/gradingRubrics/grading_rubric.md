# Unit 9 | Assignment - SQL

### Statement of completion

Limit time spent on grading and feedback to no more than 5 minutes per student.

Follow the guidelines, but use your judgment to grade each student's assignment! Keep in mind that alternative solutions exist to many of the provided solutions. There are a total of 29 question items.

### A

* The student has attempted all questions, and has provided correct solutions for nearly all of the 29 problems.

### B

* The student has attempted and correctly answered at least twenty questions.

### C

* The student has attempted at least half of the questions, and has provided at least ten correct solutions.

### D

* If only a minimum portion of the homework was attempted, assign a D. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### F

* If the student turned in nothing, the student receives an F.

* Explain why the student received that grade, and invite him or her to visit office hours for help.

### I (Incomplete)

* Students should receive this grade **only** if they are submitting empty repositories. If the student has still attempted the homework assignment and was unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a letter grade, not an 'Incomplete.'
